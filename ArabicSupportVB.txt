Question 1: How can I develop an Arabic application using Visual Basic 6.0?

Answer
First, you need to install the Arabic language pack for Windows XP or Windows 2000, to be able to use the RightToLeft property. 
On Windows 2000: "Regional Options" in the "General" tab, add Arabic to the "Language setting for the system"

On Windows XP: "Regional and Language Options" go to the "Advanced" tab and change the "Language for non Unicode programs" to an Arabic language.

PS. This will not affect the user interface language.
